# Pursuit-of-Flavour
Personalized Cooking app made for you!

Overview:

With the surge of food delivery apps and the abundance of restaurants, it is evident that the younger generation has lost confidence in the kitchen. According to a survey conducted by Morgan Stanely, approximately 53% of millennials are eating out at restaurants as compared to 43% of baby boomers. If this trend continues, the unsustainable habit of constantly eating out will definitely have a negative financial and physical impact on current and future generations. Currently, this problem is arguably not only unsolved, but further deepened by the way our society values productivity, capitalism and marketing. As more and more restaurants and new businesses emerge, less and less home-cooked meals are made.

The app we plan to build is named Pursuit of Flavor. It is an augmented cooking application which aims to solve the cooking problem youths are facing as well as to encourage cooking rather than eating out. Based on research, many have stated that they refused to cook because they did not know what to buy at the grocery store, lacked the knowledge or skill to do so, and always have trouble deciding what to make. Our app offers unique features to solve each of those problems which will help develop the users’ cooking habits and skills allowing them to live a healthier and better lifestyle.

The target audience for our app is anyone and everyone who would like to cook delicious meals and enjoy healthy lifestyles, ranging from children all the way to seniors. Our app will ensure that it offers useful and easy to use features for all users.

Features:

Our project includes the use of many individual features, implemented by a variety of APIs including Google Maps, Instacart, Photo and Speech API.

1. Our app will give users the ability to search for various recipes by using various cooking APIS and will help users to find videos that provide step by step instructions on how to cook each recipe. 
2. It will provide users with a list of ingredients that are needed to cook the dish. We are hoping to integrate our application with Instacart API. It will give users the choice to purchase the ingredients that they lack.
3. It will have a login feature where users will be able to see what dishes they have cooked recently and be provided with suggestions on what other dishes they should try based on their recent history. 
4. We are also hoping to add the locations of the nearest grocery stores concerning the user’s location with the help of GoogleMaps API so that they can buy the ingredients from the places which are nearby.
5. Our app will make use of the Google Speech Recognition API to create a cooking helper that will guide the user through each step of the cooking process.
6. Our app will keep track of a list of the ingredients that the users already have and suggest meals that the users can make based on what they currently have.
7. A feature that allows users to upload a photo of their fridge implemented by a Photo recognition API (like Cloud Vision). This can add ingredients to a database that keeps track of ingredients.

Sample User Stories:

1. The user has a recipe they have selected to be cooked. However, the user does not have all the required ingredients for the recipe in their home. The user will be notified of the situation and given a list of the ingredients they are missing. A map will appear containing nearby grocery store locations where the user can buy those items. There will be an option to buy ingredients off of Instacart. If the user chooses to use Instacart, the user will be brought to the Instacart page to purchase the necessary ingredients. Once the user has all the ingredients, they can proceed to interact with the cooking helper to make the recipe.

2. The user has selected the recipe he/she wants to cook and clicked on the cooking helper. The cooking helper will process the current recipe and begin interacting with the user. The cooking helper will voice out the first step for the user to do, and as the user completes the step he/she can talk to the cooking helper for the next step. He/she can also go to the previous step if they missed anything. The cooking helper will also help the user keep track of the cooking time. Once the user completes the steps and the cooking process, he/she can exit out of the cooking helper.

Goals:

By combining different features into a seamless experience for the users, we can give them a comfortable-to-use application that makes it easier for them to cook healthier dishes. Saving time is one of the most important features we are going to focus on, therefore, we are going to integrate different APIs into our app. For example, by integrating our app with Instacart, our app will become time-efficient as it will keep the time it takes, from searching for a recipe on our app to acquiring the necessary ingredients, as low as possible.
